---Lect 33------

Use mtcars R dataset provided by the: 
data(mtcars) command; 
• Display the first 6 observations (head(mtcars)) and the 
variable names (names(mtcars)); 
• Describe each variable in the dataset with a few words 
(data manual); you can find that information by using the 
command ?mtcars; 
• Classify cars into “automatic” vs “manual” transmission 
using a CART decision tree and the other variables as 
features; interpret the tree. 
• Plot the tree; what do you see? 
• Calculate the AUC (note: we are using the same data for 
training and calculating AUC). 
• Submit your R file IN11_1.R by next Monday.

Use mtcars R dataset provided by the: 
data(mtcars) command; 
• Display the first 6 observations (head(mtcars)) and the 
variable names (names(mtcars)); 
• Describe each variable in the dataset with a few words 
(data manual); you can find that information by using 
the command ?mtcars; 
• Train a knn, decision tree and logistic model on this 
data. Get predictions on the same training data. 
• Calculate and compare the AUC and system time for 
each algorithm. Which one does better? Do you run 
into any problems? 
• Submit your R file IN11_2.R by next Monday.

Use mtcars R dataset provided by the: 
data(mtcars) command; 
• Display the first 6 observations (head(mtcars)) and the variable 
names (names(mtcars)); 
• Describe each variable in the dataset with a few words (data 
manual); you can find that information by using the command 
?mtcars; 
• Train a naïve Bayes algorithm on this data. Get predictions on the 
same training data. 
• Calculate and the AUC and system time. Compare to the algos from 
Inclass2. Which one does better? Do you run into any problems? 
• Submit one R file with the four algo (tree, logistic, knn, naïve bayes, 
system times and AUC on train data to Dropbox by Monday, 
November 17, 1pm .
