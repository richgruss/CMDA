Principal Components Analysis

unsupervised learning

great for reducing dimensionality of huge data

reducing 60 "suitcases" to 1 or 2 or 3

create new variables--"principle components" with decreasing information in each

commonly distributed with packages

each new variable is going to be some linear combinations of some of the original variables

optical recognition of numbers 0-9
64 attributes (pixels?)
