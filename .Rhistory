"There are over 400 variables, corresponding to both basic biodemographic data and answers to survey questions.
Each question has a code for 'Don't know/refused', so for aggregate operations that involve rows with missing data, it is safe
to drop those records. We're really only interested in the biodemo questions, fitness, and movies question.
We've narrowed it down to 108 variables.  This creates a smaller dataframe with only the columns listed in
the file pewSocialNamesSubset.txt."
