reasons to subsample:

-visualizations are too crowded with too much data (scatter plots)
-easier to see patterns on an small scale
-easier to run code against 100 lines vs. 1 million
-train and test splits

case for normalizing: to determine whether you qualify for food stamps, we see your income relative to poverty line.

z-score: (val-mean)/std.dev (center on mean, val is # of st.dev away from mean)
